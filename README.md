Half of the notes are input by the user, the patch generates the remaining ones.

The user can input up to four simultaneous notes, that are spread over the first four steps of the sequence. In order to do so, the notes must be pressed and hold at the same time, like the usual procedure for arpeggiators. Any note added beyond the fourth one will be spread starting over from step `1` to `4` (i.e. notes `5`-`6` are going to replace notes `1`-`2`). In the current version, generated notes are based on relative one-octave major scale of the correspondent upward input note (note value in step `1` will be the root note of the major scale from which the patch will create the note for step `5`, note value in step `2` for step `6`, and so on...). The `toggles` on the sequencer turn on/off the correspondent step.

The `FREEZE` (`‚ùÑ`) section controls generated notes. User can de-activate constant refresh of notes generation by turning on the button relative to single steps (hence 'freezing' the current note): by doing so, the note will refresh only when a new one will be input in the other half correspondent step. Switching from `ADD` to `SUB` will generate notes in a mirrored major progression toward the lower octave.

`RUN` runs the sequence, `RESET` resets it to the first step.

The sequencer has a tempo division menu. By activating `AUTO`, divisions will change randomly.

`SWING` controls the sequencer swing, `STEPS` sets the overall number of steps, `DUR` controls the duration of notes gate.
